# Datasets
Toy datasets for fast Oxford Nanopore assembly

## Purpose
We wish to put together a set of Oxford Nanopore data that is fast to assemble.
There are several advantages including

* Fast to test new bioinformatics workflows
* Fast to teach new people ONT assembly
* Fast to teach people bioinformatics workflows in a workshop setting
